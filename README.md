## 🚀 Projects
- [**NBody Simulator**](https://github.com/vitinh0z/NBody-Simulator.git)
_Gravitational simulator developed in Java, using numerical integration to compute N-body forces and update trajectories in discrete time steps. Real-time rendering powered by JavaFX, supporting thousands of particles with performance optimizations._
  
- [**Tablet Monitor System**](https://github.com/vitinh0z/ServerWithTelemetrics) _Real-time monitoring system that turns an old Android tablet into a telemetry server. The device collects metrics (CPU, RAM, battery, temperature) and sends them via WebSocket to a Spring Boot server, which broadcasts the data to multiple clients in real time._

- [**Robotic Process Automation (RPA) for Job Scraping**](https://github.com/vitinh0z/ServerWithTelemetrics) _High-throughput Java 21 RPA service implementing resilient web/API scraping, semantic vacancy filtering, deduplication persistence, and real-time dispatch via Discord Webhooks. Packaged with Docker and deployed through GitHub Actions on Fly.io for automated CI/CD and container orchestration._
